# Crux Python Client

A Python library for interacting with the Crux platform.

The aim of this module is to be a Pythonic way to use the Crux API reliably. It covers client functionality including scanning subscriptions, getting delivery status, and downloading files.

Python 3.6+ is supported.

**See [crux-python.cruxinformatics.com](https://crux-python.cruxinformatics.com/) for detailed documentation.**

## Installation

Install a recent version of Python, and a Python dependency and virtual environment manager like [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). On macOS run:

```bash
brew install python
brew install pipenv
```

Install `crux` [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/crux/) in a virtual environment, and get a shell in that environment:

```bash
mkdir -p crux_example
cd crux_example
pipenv install "crux==1.1"
pipenv shell
```
## Getting Started

Create a file, like example.py, and use the `crux` module:

```python
from crux import Crux

conn = Crux()
identity = conn.whoami()
print("I am", identity.email)
```

Run the script:

```bash
HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth
 export CRUX_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
python3 example.py
```

See the [installation](https://crux-python.cruxinformatics.com/en/latest/installation.html) and [authentication](https://crux-python.cruxinformatics.com/en/latest/authentication.html) documentation for details.

## Development

Python 3.7 is required for development, which can be installed with `brew install python`. For heavy development work, every supported version of Python must be installed, see the pyenv documentation below.

[Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) should be used to manage dependancies during development.

1. [Install Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv), on macOS run `brew install pipenv`
2. `git clone https://github.com/cruxinformatics/crux-python.git`
3. `cd crux-python`
4. `pipenv install --dev` to install the dependancies
5. `pipenv shell` to get a shell in the virtual environment

### Multiple Python versions

To be able to run tests against all supported Python versions, you must have all supported Python versions installed. The test runner will look for binaries called `python2.7`, `python3.5`, `python3.6`, etc. There are multiple ways to install Python versions, we'll document using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

1. `brew install pyenv` to install
2. Put `eval "$(pyenv init -)"` towards the end of the shell configuration file (~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile), because it manipulates `$PATH`, for example:

    ```bash
    echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

3. Open a new Terminal to get an updated shell
4. Install required/missing Python versions (this assumes you have Python 2.7 already installed, otherwise install it too):

    ```bash
    pyenv install 3.5.6
    pyenv install 3.6.6
    pyenv install 3.7.0
    ```

5. `pyenv global system 3.5.6 3.6.6 3.7.0` to make all the Python versions available
6. If you already have pipenv virtual environment, remove it with `pipenv --rm` so it detects the Python versions
7. `pipenv install --dev` to install all the dependancies
8. `pipenv shell` to get a shell in the virtual environment

### Running tests

We use [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/) to automate running tests, and use `make` to automate running some commands. These commands should be run within a shell created with `pipenv shell`.

```bash
# Run all tests: lint, unit, format_check
make test
# Or
nox

# Run only lint checks
make lint
# Or
nox -s lint

# Run unit tests against all available Python versions
make unit
# Or
nox -s unit

# Run integration tests agains all available Python versions
 export CRUX_API_KEY="12345"
export CRUX_API_HOST="https://api.example.com"
make integration
# Or
 export CRUX_API_KEY="12345"
export CRUX_API_HOST="https://api.example.com"
nox --s integration

# Check formatting
make format_check
# Or
nox -s format_check

# List all commands available
make
# Or
nox -l

# Run unit test only against Python 3.7
nox -s unit-3.7

# Reformat code
make format

# Generate Sphinx HTML documentation
make docs
```

#### Running test scripts

Manual testing scripts could be found at `tests/regression`.
In order to run one, i.e. `client.py`, follow the steps:

1. copy corresponding `.env.dist` file as `.env` file (if you plan to run `client.py`, copy `client.env.dist` as `client.env`)
2. fill variables within `.env` file
3. launch the script (while being in the `tests/regression` folder, execute `python client.py`)
